### Intro
First time using ChatGPT to assist my AWS and Terraform knowledge in building and troubleshooting a small, scalable yet extendable, cloud project end-to-end for learning purposes. Beginner to intermediate level. Enjoy!

### Architecture
![cloud-infra-lab](https://jq1-io.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/projects/cloud-infra-lab.png)

### Prerequisites
AWS:
- `aws` cli installed and configured.

Zone and Domain:
- Must own the DNS zone via some domain registrar.
  - AWS Route53 zone resource should already exist (either manually or in Terraform).
  - Demo looks up the zone resource by name.
- Change the `zone_name` variable in [variables.tf](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/cloud-infra-lab/blob/9f4aece88c584679e38c7974beb5c22e6bde100f/variables.tf#L21) to your own zone.

IPAM Configuration:
- There are many ways to configure IPAM so I manually created IPAM pools (advanced tier) in the AWS UI.
- You'll need to configure your own IPv4 pools/subpools in IPAM.
- Advanced Tier IPAM in `us-west-2` operating reigons.
  - No IPv4 regional pools at the moment.
  - `us-west-2` (ipam locale)
    - IPv4 Pool (private scope)
      - Description: `ipv4-test-usw2`
      - Provisioned CIDRs:
        - `10.0.0.0/18`

### Begin Demo
Build:
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply`
- profit!

Tear Down:
- Remove RDS deletion protection:
  - `aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier test-app-mysql --no-deletion-protection --apply-immediately --region us-west-2`
- Destroy resources:
  - `terraform destroy`
  - note: vpcs will take 10-15min to destroy due to IPAM taking a long
    time to release the IP.
- Force delete the secrets manager path instead of waiting for scheduled deletion:
  - `aws secretsmanager delete-secret --region us-west-2 --secret-id rds/test/mysql/app --force-delete-without-recovery --region us-west-2`
- Delete snapshot that was created when destroying the DB.
  - `aws rds delete-db-snapshot --db-snapshot-identifier test-app-mysql-final-snapshot --region us-west-2`

### Endpoints
Health Check:
- `https://cloud.some.domain/` -> `Health: OK: MaD GrEEtz!`

RDS Connectivity Checks:
- `https://cloud.some.domain/app1` -> `App1: MySQL OK (or MySQL Error)`
- `https://cloud.some.domain/app2` -> `App2: MySQL OK (or MySQL Error)`

### TODO
Modularize (OO style):
- `alb.tf`
- `asg.tf`
- `rds.tf`

### Components
Application Load Balancer (ALB):
- HTTPS (TLS 1.2 & 1.3) with ACM + ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG):
- EC2 instances with cloud-init & socat health endpoints.
- Scales based on CPU utilization.
- Deployed across multiple AZs.
- Auto deploy instance refresh using latest launch template version after the launch template is modfied.
  - The config prioritizes availability (launch before terminate) over cost control (terminate before launch).
  - Only one instance refresh can be run at a time or it will error.
  - View in progress instance refreshes with `aws autoscaling describe-instance-refreshes --auto-scaling-group-name test-web-asg --region us-west-2`
  - Current demo configuration will take up to 10min for a refresh to finish.

NGINX reverse proxy + Socat Health Checks:
- Path-based routing: /app1, /app2.
- /app1 and /app2 return MySQL health.
- Uses socat for reliable TCP responses.
- Lightweight bash scripts to simulate apps.
- mysql -e "SELECT 1" run with credentials pulled from Secrets Manager.

Amazon RDS (MySQL):
- Multi-AZ with encryption via custom KMS key.
- Access controlled by SGs (only from ASG instances).
- Secrets (MySQL creds) stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Security Groups:
- Fine-grained rules for ALB â†” EC2 â†” RDS.
- Outbound rules configured for necessary security groups.

Scaling Behavior:
- Scale Out: if average CPU > 70% for 2 minutes.
- Scale In: if average CPU < 30% for 2 minutes.
- Policies managed via CloudWatch alarms + ASG.

VPC:
- Uses Tiered VPC-NG module.
- Requires IPAM.
- VPC Endpoint for sending s3 traffic direct to s3 instead of traversing IGW or NATGW.
